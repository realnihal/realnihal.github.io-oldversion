<p>It’s 2020, the year that gripped the world in its fingertips. I’m talking about the COVID pandemic. If you are here from years in to the future I hope that the world is back to normal. As of now its almost 16 months into isolation, and all of my education is now online. To be completly honest as an introvert I quite fancied myself to be “fine”, But yeah even i struggled. During the first few months of staying at home, I did what almost every teen did study, spend time with family, binge watch TV series and play video games all day. With time as you can imagine it was boring. I wanted to do something else, I wanted to create something.</p>

<p>I guess its the engineer inside me talking. Speaking of which I am an aerospace engineering student at the Indian Institute of Technology. And my mind set of on a quest to make something. I stood up looked around and thought deeply. In my mind i had <em>nothing</em>. This was’nt the lab or workshop like at campus its just a bedroom. I can’t even go outside cuz of the pandemic. All I had was a my Laptop (<em>Jarvis</em>).</p>
