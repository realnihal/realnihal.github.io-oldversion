<p>It‚Äôs 2020, the year that gripped the world at its fingertips. I‚Äôm talking about the COVID pandemic. If you are here from years into the future, I hope the world is back to normal. As of now, it‚Äôs almost 16 months into isolation, and all of my education is now online. As an introvert, I quite fancied myself to be ‚Äúfine‚Äù, But yeah, even I struggled. During the first few months of staying at home, all I did was study, spend time with family, binge watch TV series and play video games all day. With time as you can imagine, it was boring. I wanted to do something else;</p>

  <p>I wanted to create something.</p>

<p>I guess it‚Äôs the engineer inside me talking. Speaking of which, I am an aerospace engineering student at the Indian Institute of Technology. And my mindset of being on a quest to make something. I stood up, looked around and thought deeply. In my mind, I had <em>nothing</em>‚Äîthis wasn‚Äôt the lab or workshop like at campus it‚Äôs just a bedroom. I can‚Äôt even go outside because of the pandemic. All I had was my Laptop (<em>Jarvis</em>).</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt know how to code, I took an introductory programming course at college, but we never really made anything. To add, I should also say that I feared coding in general. It all seemed too complicated for me. But it was time; I had to beat the fear. If I was to make something cool/practical/fun, I‚Äôve got to learn to code.</p>

<p>So, I did.</p>

<p>In June, 2020 I started learning python. Its a basic language that can be used to build cool things (this is all I knew about it). And fast forward a year and a bit, I‚Äôm here now.</p>
