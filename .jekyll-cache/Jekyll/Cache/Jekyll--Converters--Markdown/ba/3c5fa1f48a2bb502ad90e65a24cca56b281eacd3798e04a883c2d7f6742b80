<p>Itâ€™s 2020, the year that gripped the world at its fingertips. Iâ€™m talking about the COVID pandemic. If you are here from years into the future, I hope the world is back to normal. As of now, itâ€™s almost 16 months into isolation, and all of my education is now online. As an introvert, I quite fancied myself to be â€œfineâ€, But yeah, even I struggled. During the first few months of staying at home, all I did was study, spend time with family, binge watch TV series and play video games all day. With time as you can imagine, it was boring. I wanted to do something else, I wanted to create something.</p>

<p>I guess itâ€™s the engineer inside me talking. Speaking of which, I am an aerospace engineering student at the Indian Institute of Technology. And my mindset of being on a quest to make something. I stood up, looked around and thought deeply. In my mind, I had <em>nothing</em>â€”this wasnâ€™t the lab or workshop like at campus itâ€™s just a bedroom. I canâ€™t even go outside because of the pandemic. All I had was my Laptop (<em>Jarvis</em>).</p>

<p>I didnâ€™t know how to code, I took an introductory programming course at college, but we never really made anything. To add, I should also say that I feared coding in general. It all seemed too complicated for me. But it was time; I had to beat the fear. If I was to make something cool/practical/fun, Iâ€™ve got to learn to code.</p>

  <p>â€œSo, I did.â€</p>

<p>In June, 2020 I started learning python. Its a basic language that can be used to build cool things (this is all I knew about it). And fast forward a year and a bit, Iâ€™m here now. Iâ€™ve enjoyed my journey in the last year. Of course, it isnâ€™t by any means over. Over the last few months, I was thinking about this, and I finally got to do it right now. I created this blog to start documenting my journey. My idea is that I write about my projects, resources that helped me, and, of course, my mistakes. I will try to keep this blog informative, but Iâ€™m pretty new to writing. If you are still reading this, then, <em>â€œHi there, thank you for spending the time to know meâ€</em>.</p>

<p>Feel free to send me an email or reach out to me on any of my social channelâ€™s. I would love to hear your feedback. With that, Peace out!</p>
